Coding assignment

I have just created static html pages. Didn't use JS to render the info and display that in my html pages. Due to lack of time, I tried to just cover the flow creating static html pages categories -> movies-> movie details and backward flow for the same. I didn't complete series flow. 


By looking into yesterday's agenda I thought we need to consume csv file and display it into a table and have filters. So I had done some implementations on top of that and wanted to present that as well. To run that, simply comment my index.html current code and uncomment my commented areas in index.html. and upload my csv test file using upload button and use the filters. That is more of a JS implementation. 


Lastly, I also wanted to inform that I know how to render this json file in typescript and simply use ngfor in angular to display entire movies list in angular. and use {} in html components in angular to extract json values captured through typescript. 

I believe it would be similar in react. 

I'm not a react developer but I believe with a normal SDE skills and the past front end experience that I have I can learn react and conrtibute further. 

Whatever I did is only with my past FE experience hence, I opted for plain html,css and JS that too it's been a gap since I worked on front end (I last worked ~2 years back).
